<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p><a name="index-control-character-1"></a><a name="index-control-sequence-2"></a><a name="index-terminal-3"></a><a name="index-terminal-emulator-4"></a>
GNU Teseq is a tool for translating files that contain control
characters and terminal control sequences, into human-understandable
text. It is intended to aid in debugging problems in terminal
emulators, software that makes use of special terminal features, and
interactions between the two.

<p>It is primarily targeted at individuals who possess a basic
understanding of terminal control sequences, especially
<a name="index-g_t_0040sc_007bcsi_007d-5"></a><a name="index-Control-Sequence-Introducer-6"></a><acronym><span class="sc">csi</span></acronym> sequences; however, by default Teseq will try to
identify and describe the sequences that it encounters, and the
behavior they might produce in a terminal.

<p>Teseq describes control functions as they are interpreted by
VT100-compatible terminals, and/or terminals compliant with the
<a name="index-standards-7"></a><a name="index-Ecma_002d48-8"></a><a name="index-ISO_002fIEC_0040tie_007b_007d6429-9"></a>Ecma-48&nbsp;/ ISO/IEC&nbsp;6429 standard. Teseq does <em>not</em> support describing
control functions according to terminal-specific definitions in a
database such as
<a name="index-termcap-10"></a>termcap or
<a name="index-terminfo-11"></a>terminfo, though future versions may
include limited support for that (see <a href="Future-Enhancements.html#Future-Enhancements">Future Enhancements</a>). 
Therefore, the descriptions Teseq uses for control functions may not
necessarily match their actual interpretation by whatever terminal
device the characters were actually intended for.

<p>GNU Teseq is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>. See <a href="Copying.html#Copying">Copying</a>, for copying conditions.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">A Quick Example</h3>

<p><a name="index-examples-12"></a><a name="index-terminal-13"></a><a name="index-Hello_002c-world_0021-14"></a>
You can't beat a short example to demonstrate what a program does, so
here goes. Suppose you've got a program that writes the following
output to a terminal.

<pre class="example">     <strong>Hi</strong> <span class="roman">there, world</span>
</pre>
<p class="noindent">A simple text string, using a boldface font to render the first word.

<p>Suppose that, after a moment or two, the program then replaced the
final word &ldquo;world&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;earth&rdquo;.

<p>In order to achieve this effect, the program would have to send
special controls to the terminal to ask it to start writing in bold
text, and then to revert back to normal text for the rest. To replace
the final word, it might have to issue a series of backspaces before
issuing the replacement word. All of this will be handled
transparently by the terminal, and you wouldn't see any of the special
characters the program sent to the terminal&mdash;unless perhaps you
convinced the program to write to a text file as if it were writing to
a terminal, or ran the program under a terminal capture utility such
as the
<a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bscript_007d-15"></a><samp><span class="command">script</span></samp> command.

<p>You may be able to produce this effect yourself with the following
shell command.

<pre class="example">     $ printf '\033[1mHi\033[m there, world'; sleep 1; \
         printf '\b\b\b\b\bearth\n'
</pre>
<p class="noindent">If you were to examine the output from such a command with a text
editor, it might look something like this.

<pre class="example">     ^[[1mHi^[[m there, world^H^H^H^H^Hearth
</pre>
<p class="noindent">Not very readable, is it? That's where Teseq comes in! When you run
that gibberish through the <samp><span class="command">teseq</span></samp> command with the default
settings, you'll get the following output.

<pre class="example">     : Esc [ 1 m
     &amp; SGR: SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
     " Set bold text.
     |Hi|
     : Esc [ 0 m
     &amp; SGR: SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
     " Clear graphic rendition to defaults.
     | there, world|
     . BS/^H BS/^H BS/^H BS/^H BS/^H
     |earth|.
</pre>
<p><a name="index-line-prefix-16"></a><a name="index-prefix_002c-line-17"></a>Note that the special control sequences that tell the terminal to start
and stop writing in boldface text are separated out on their own lines
(prefixed with a colon &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;), and followed by an identification
(prefixed with an ampersand &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;) and a description of what it
does (prefixed with a quote character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;).

<p>The actual text appears in lines bracketed by pipe &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;
characters.

<p>The series of single-character backspace controls appear on a line
prefixed with a period &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, identified by its identifying acronym
(<span class="sc">bs</span> for <span class="sc">backspace</span>), and its control-key representation
(Control-H).

<p>The final word, &ldquo;earth&rdquo;, is followed by a period just
after the closing pipe symbol; this indicates a following linefeed (or
&ldquo;newline&rdquo;) character.

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007breseq_007d-18"></a>The <samp><span class="command">reseq</span></samp> command may be used to reverse the procedure,
accepting the above input and printing out the original set of escape
sequences that produced it. See <a href="Reseq.html#Reseq">Reseq</a>.
