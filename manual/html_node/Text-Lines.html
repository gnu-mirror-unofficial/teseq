<h3 class="section">3.1 Text Lines</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_007c-59"></a>Lines of plain text input, are output between a pair of pipe characters
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;, with a final period to indicate the linefeed character. 
Input:

<pre class="example">     Hello there
</pre>
<p class="noindent">Output:

<pre class="example">     |Hello there|.
</pre>
<p class="noindent">Trailing whitespace is thus made plainly visible to the reader.

<pre class="example">     |Trailing space:    |.
</pre>
<p class="noindent">A blank line is represented as empty content between the pipes.

<pre class="example">     ||.
</pre>
<p class="noindent">If the input line is too long to display as one line of output, it
will be displayed as follows, with dash characters, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, to
mark continuity at the beginnings and ends of the lines (outside the
pipe characters).

<pre class="example">     |This input line |-
     -|was too long to|-
     -| fit|.
</pre>
<p>You might wonder whether pipe characters themselves might have to be
escaped, so as to avoid confusion with the surrounding pipes. After
all, in a C string literal, denoted by double-quotes, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;, one
must escape literal double-quote characters by preceding them with a
backslash (and must then also escape literal backslashes): <code>"She
said \"no\""</code>. However, no such escaping mechanism is needed in Teseq. 
Input:

<pre class="example">     A line with a pipe | in it, and a line with just a pipe
     |
</pre>
<p class="noindent">Output:

<pre class="example">     |A line with a pipe | in it, and a line with just a pipe|.
     |||.
</pre>
<p class="noindent">No special treatment whatsoever!

<p>The reason Teseq can get away with this is that the pipe character only
has its special &ldquo;mark the enclosed as normal text&rdquo; meaning, when it
is the first and the last character on a line of output (aside from a
possible prefacing dash to indicate a wrapped line, or a trailing dash
or period).

<p>A lot of the output lines you've seen so far have all ended with a
period, denoting the linefeed character. However, this isn't always
the case. For instance, if the input line contains a control
character, Teseq will close the text line (with just a pipe, no
period), print a control-character line with the control characters,
and then finish up the rest of the text line. The following sample
output represents a single line which contains a delete character and
a null character:

<pre class="example">     |Fee fi|
     . DEL/^?
     |fo|
     . NUL/^@
     |fum|.
</pre>
<p class="noindent">And here's a line that's terminated with a carriage-return/line-feed
combination, rather than just a linefeed.

<pre class="example">     |The promised line|
     . CR/^M LF/^J
</pre>
<p class="noindent">The linefeed character is special: when it's preceded by control
characters or escape sequence, it's printed as a control character;
when it's preceded by text characters (or by nothing at all), it's
printed as that final dot thing. This behavior is designed to make a
newline look like the end of a line or a blank line when it should,
and to look like a control character when it should.

<p>And of course, if the final line in the file is missing a newline, the
dot won't appear there either.

<p>Currently, the only characters included in text lines, are those from
the printable range of characters from US
<a name="index-standards-60"></a><a name="index-ASCII-61"></a>ASCII (<a name="index-standards-62"></a><a name="index-Ecma_002d6-63"></a><a name="index-ISO-646-64"></a>Ecma-6&nbsp;/ ISO&nbsp;646)&mdash;and sometimes linefeed, represented by the special
final-dot notation. This means that if the terminal was using a
character set that high-value code points, all high-valued bytes will
be represented in hexadecimal on control-character lines, and not
displayed on a text line. Future versions of Teseq may provide options
allowing for these characters to be represented properly in text
lines, but for now, the output format is ASCII characters only. 
See <a href="Future-Directions.html#Future-Directions">Future Directions</a>.

<p>Note that even characters falling in the normal range of ASCII
printable characters may not necessarily be represented correctly: for
instance, if escape codes are present in the input that would switch
the terminal to a different national variant of <a name="index-standards-65"></a><a name="index-Ecma_002d6-66"></a><a name="index-ISO-646-67"></a>Ecma-6&nbsp;/ ISO&nbsp;646, then the real
terminal might display (say, for ISO-646ES)
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&Ntilde;</span></samp>&rsquo;
instead of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo;; but the output from Teseq will not change based on this (even
though it will recognize and identify the control sequences that
invoke that character set for use).
