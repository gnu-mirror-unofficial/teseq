<h3 class="section">3.5 Description Lines</h3>

<p><a name="index-description-line-134"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0022-135"></a>Description lines begin with the double-quote, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="example">     " Move the cursor up 2 lines.
</pre>
<p class="noindent">Sequences of description lines are generally preceded by a label line
(unless the
<a name="index-g_t_002dL-136"></a><samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> option was supplied), and describe the same
control function labeled by that line. More than one description line
may be used to describe a function, whereas only one label line is
ever used for a control function.

<p>It is important to understand that the descriptions provided are only
approximations and guesses, and suffer from various limitations. The
behavior of many control functions are dependent on terminal state
that Teseq does not track. Teseq chooses a common default setting for
applicable terminal modes, and issues a description based on that. For
instance, the <span class="sc">insert line</span> function is described as follows:

<pre class="example">     : Esc [ 2 L
     &amp; IL: INSERT LINE
     " Shift lines after the cursor to make room for 2 new lines.
</pre>
<p class="noindent">However, depending on the current setting of the
<span class="sc">line editing mode</span>, the actual behavior might be to shift the
lines <em>before</em> the cursor, rather than the ones after. Future
versions of Teseq may track enough terminal state to improve the
accuracy of these descriptions (see <a href="Future-Enhancements.html#Future-Enhancements">Future Enhancements</a>), but they
would still need to guess at the initial state of the terminal, for
any modes that had not been explicitly set or reset.

<p>Descriptions are also often inaccurate. For instance, the description
for <span class="sc">insert line</span> should really read &ldquo;shift the current line and
the lines after the cursor<small class="dots">...</small>&rdquo;. In addition, no mention is made of
the fact that the extent of the shifted part is dependent on previous
invocations of <span class="sc">select editing extent</span>. A conscious decision has
been made to value brevity over accuracy.

<p>Also, the descriptions are based (loosely) on the semantics defined by
<a name="index-standards-137"></a><a name="index-Ecma_002d48-138"></a><a name="index-ISO_002fIEC_0040tie_007b_007d6429-139"></a>Ecma-48&nbsp;/ ISO/IEC&nbsp;6429. There is no guarantee that this corresponds to the
semantics defined for the actual terminal on which these functions
were invoked. The terminal may have different behavior, or may not
even accept the function. The descriptions are intended as a rough aid in
remembering what a given function does; to really understand the
actual semantics of a function, you should read the terminal device's
documentation, and/or <a name="index-standards-140"></a><a name="index-Ecma_002d48-141"></a><a name="index-ISO_002fIEC_0040tie_007b_007d6429-142"></a>Ecma-48&nbsp;/ ISO/IEC&nbsp;6429.

<p>Description lines currently are never wrapped; however, future
versions of Teseq may wrap label lines. At that time, continuation
label lines will probably consist of an extra space after the
double-quote (just as label lines are wrapped). Lines will never be
split in the middle of a word.

<p>Future versions of Teseq may use description lines to describe thigns
besides escape sequences; for instance, control characters or control
strings, or other strings that may be interpreted specially by some
devices or applications.

<p>Some description lines may appear without a preceding label line (even
when <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> was not specified), in the event that no standard
designation for the function is known.
